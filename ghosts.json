Black and full\n\nof hot drool, eyes the color of a lung—it'd follow me\n\nhome if I stayed past my curfew. How to tell my friends\n\nto press Pause in the middle of a video, say their good-byes\n\nwhile I shuffled up the stairs and into my father's waiting\n\nblue car? How to explain this to my dates, whisper\n\nwhy we could not finish this dance? It's not like the pig\n\nhad any special powers or could take a tiny bite\n\nfrom my leg—only assurances that it was simply\n\nscandal to be followed home. When my date and I\n\npull into my driveway and dim the lights, we take\n\ncare to make all the small noises that get made\n\nin times like these even smaller: squeaks in the seats,\n\na slow spin of the radio dial, the silver click of my belt.\n\nToo late. A single black hair flickers awake the ear\n\nof the dark animal waiting for me at the end of the walk.\n\nMy fumbling of keys and various straps a wild dance\n\nto the door—the pig grunting in tune to each hurried step, each\n\nof his wet breaths puffing into tiny clouds, a small storm brewing."

I hear again,\n\nWithin, the scutter where the mice carouse,\n\nWithout, the gutter dropping with the rain.\n\nOpposite, are black shelves of wormy books,\n\nTo left, glazed cases, dusty with the same,\n\nBehind, a wall, with rusty guns on hooks,\n\nTo right, the fire, that chokes one panting flame.\n\nOver the mantel, black as funeral cloth,\n\nA portrait hangs, a man, whose flesh the worm\n\nHas mawed this hundred years, whose clothes the moth\n\nA century since, has channelled to a term.\n\nI cannot see his face : I only know\n\nHe stares at me, that man of long ago.\n\n\n\nI light the candles in the long brass sticks,\n\nI see him now, a pale-eyed, simpering man,\n\nFramed in carved wood, wherein the death-watch ticks,\n\nA most dead face : yet when the work began\n\nThat face, the pale puce coat, the simpering smile,\n\nThe hands that hold a book, the eyes that gaze,\n\nMoved to the touch of mind a little while.\n\nThe painter sat in judgment on his ways :\n\nThe painter turned him to and from the light,\n\nTalked about art, or bade him lift his head.\n\nJudged the lips’ paleness and the temples’ white,\n\nAnd now his work abides ; the man is dead.\n\nBut is he dead ? This dusty study drear\n\nCreaks in its panels that the man is here.\n\n\n\nHere, beyond doubt, he lived, in that old day.\n\n“He was a Doctor here,” the student thought.\n\nHere, when the puce was new, that now is grey,\n\nThat simpering man his daily practice wrought.\n\nHere he let blood, prescribed the pill and drop,\n\nThe leech, the diet ; here his verdict given\n\nBrought agonies of hoping to a stop,\n\nHere his condemned confessioners were shriven.\n\nWhat is that book he holds, the key, too dim\n\nTo read, to know ; some little book he wrote,\n\nForgotten now, but still the key to him.\n\nHe sacrificed his vision for his coat.\n\nI see the man ; a simpering mask that hid\n\nA seeing mind that simpering men forbid.\n\n\n\nThose are his books no doubt, untoucht, undusted,\n\nUnread, since last he left them on the shelves,\n\nOctavo sermons that the fox has rusted,\n\nSides splitting off from brown decaying twelves.\n\nThis was his room, this darkness of old death,\n\nThis coffin-room with lights like embrasures,\n\nThe place is poisonous with him ; like a breath\n\nOn glass, he stains the spirit ; he endures.\n\nHere is his name within the sermon book,\n\nAnd verse, “When hungry Worms my Body eat” ;\n\nHe leans across my shoulder as I look,\n\nHe who is God or pasture to the wheat.\n\nHe who is Dead is still upon the soul\n\nA check, an inhibition, a control.\n\n\n\nI draw the bolts. I am alone within.\n\nThe moonlight through the coloured glass comes faint,\n\nMottling the passage wall like human skin,\n\nPale with the breathings left of withered paint.\n\nBut others walk the empty house with me,\n\nThere is no loneliness within these walls\n\nNo more than there is stillness in the sea\n\nOr silence in the eternal waterfalls.\n\nThere in the room, to right, they sit at feast ;\n\nThe dropping grey-beard with the cold blue eye,\n\nThe lad, his son, that should have been a priest,\n\nAnd he, the rake, who made his mother die.\n\nAnd he, the gambling man, who staked the throw,\n\nThey look me through, they follow when I go.\n\n\n\nThey follow with still footing down the hall,\n\nI know their souls, those fellow-tenants mine,\n\nTheir shadows dim those colours on the wall,\n\nThey point my every gesture with a sign.\n\nThat grey-beard cast his aged servant forth\n\nAfter his forty years of service done,\n\nThe gambler supped up riches as the north\n\nSups with his death the glories of the sun.\n\nThe lad betrayed his trust ; the rake was he\n\nWho broke two women’s hearts to ease his own :\n\nThey nudge each other as they look at me,\n\nShadows, all our, and yet as hard as stone.\n\nAnd there, he comes, that simpering man, who sold\n\nHis mind for coat of puce and penny gold.\n\n\n\nO ruinous house, within whose corridors\n\nNone but the wicked and the mad go free.\n\n(On the dark stairs they wait, behind the doors\n\nThey crouch, they watch, or creep to follow me.)\n\nDeep in old blood your ominous bricks are red,\n\nFirm in old bones your walls’ foundations stand,\n\nWith dead men’s passions built upon the dead,\n\nWith broken hearts for lime and oaths for sand.\n\nTerrible house, whose horror I have built,\n\nSin after sin, unseen, as sand that slips\n\nTelling the time, till now the heaped guilt\n\nCries, and the planets circle to eclipse.\n\nYou only are the Daunter, you alone\n\nClutch, till I feel your ivy on the bone."

She watched it move.Low and angular, not quite as catlikeas one might suppose, but still, it was him.She walked to the door, just like in the old days,and opened it, and met a whoosh of winter air.She waited. The bones in the glass case rattled.Then the cat-shadow darted at her,through her legs, and slipped outside.It mingled with the shadows of bare branches,and leapt at the shadow of a bird.She looked at the tree, but there was no bird.Then he blended into the shadow of a bush.She stood in the threshold, her hands on the door,the sharp breeze ruffling the faded flowersof her house dress, and she could feelher own bones rattling in her body,her own shadow trying to slip out."

If the\n\n\ninstrument makes probable this oral hahucination, you spin the record of your reddened choice. Or. You mimic the melody and its blank harmony. You\n\n\naccompany the symphony with a tenor of all tomorrows. While I, lost in the\n\n\nMaze of Mirrors, ask you to tell me again the story.\n\n\nYou say, First. You say, Make. First, make your mouth make a sound. Speak into\n\n\nthe mouthpiece and cause the tremors in the thin diaphragm. Then. The steel\n\n\npoint makes tracings upon the hard wax. Fix the thing upon a spinning cylinder.\n\n\nAnd. By means of the tracings, the diaphragm will repeat with perfection your\n\n\noriginal voice. Or. The echoes in the mountains of your lamentations. As. Cries\n\n\nin a haunted brothel. Or. Whispers in a ghostly tavern. The instrument has\n\n\nspoken in our hearing. Listen. It is a natural outcome of the telephone. Listen.\n\n\nThe old man's laugh comes to us as out of a phonograph.\n\n\nI say, Perfect. I say, Yet. This instrument warbles. And. This record is warped.\n\n\nAnd. The tongue of this snake. Has scratched this disk. For. Your voice is\n\n\nskipping. And. As I put the conch to my same hear, I listen to the echo of. I\n\n\nlisten to the echo of. The raspy susurrations of your adieu.\n\n\nApplied to a person or thing that exactly reproduces the utterances of another\n\n\nperson or thing. Hence, the transitive verb. To report in Pitman's phonograph.\n\n\nAs. It is a great loss to me that your song was not phonographed and preserved.\n\n\nAnd. Whether it be so, it is phonographed in the mind of the mindful God. All\n\n\nout of sync."

It is sometimes sufficient to beg\n\nLice creeping over one, kill them with a chemical;\n\nthen there are lice-ghosts everywhere. Glints of pearly\n\nnails. The light of my beloved will keep me from noticing.\n\nTrailer to keep her in; he asked me if I knew her ‘auction name.’\n\nWalked over the scorch; what are values when there’s nothing here?\n\nThe wing of a dead soul grows into all the lace you see through,\n\nforeigner, lice-ridden article of divestment. Splendid vices\n\npouring outcomes over the eager cash flow promotions.\n\nSo many of the dead came to me that their transparencies\n\ncovered my visage, I’m too near you. Don’t you want to see?\n\nWe came from faraway camps, forsaking the human because it\n\nbroke our bodies into pieces for the torturer’s pet, who\n\npropositions you. There is always a slant on it. The trees must\n\ngo down; or light affects your eyes badly. We pleaded for an\n\nadjustment, before we’d recognizably died. You\n\ntold me you were a heart, but you were guarding a tower. You\n\nsaid you were a failure, but you helped destroy us.\n\nWings all over me, stuck to my skin, there’s no point to it\n\nwhy are you here when there’s nothing? We just don’t believe it.Now not no never you. I wasn’t you. You have to talk to me\n\nmy name is irretrievable. No one letting you go because you\n\nare prized for not existing except as a body, now not.\n\nNo I don’t exist, alighting and ghoulishly begging you for a\n\ndrop of your blood, a morsel of your flesh. Yes take some of\n\nme, though there are so many others with flesh. But they’re too\n\nrich to give. I know they will never let you in, you beautiful\n\nkids who haunt the corridors extending through\n\nthe invisible world, so you can find your way. So you can see\n\npast the smoke of disastrous fear acting out of dreams:\n\nit creeps everywhere. See how it took them over, for\n\nthey had no mind to stand against any fantasy the instigators\n\nchose. Had no minds at all. When I was little, no one told\n\nme I’d have to suffer. Who can be a child? And the ghoul\n\npatiently explains how the wing of a word can extend till the\n\nbarrier is made, so they can’t see us. If you say beauty, that\n\nwill be ignored, and we can hide. It was his name a long time ago,\n\nbefore the auctions began. Her face then was large and younger.\n\nShe can be lice or ghoul. I want that, I don’t want action. But I\n\nwill have to live off bits of you.The new definition of witch is one who lets them eat you, if they have to. Because you keep regenerating. Oh that’s such an oldy, and all that flying. Sometimes they do—the man who showed me a few things sits all day. The teaching is to let them come as far as inside you even, empty enough; I can hear them and render affection Why, if there’s nothing? Is this nothing? But you are destroyed We shake all the time. You remind me of someone else I knew. The wing is inscribed, forinvolute. Not to beg in the offering of primal services, we have come here. No one would let us tell anything but our bodily humiliations; had to do differently, not for redemption, because we are more than redemption. I am my maker. The shape formed by the bits of mirror glued on is unimportant. They’re inside my chest and stomach, and they glitter in there. Then if light disattaches, comes up to be spoken, you can see and you can hear. This is true because each of you has this too. Has all the bright pieces inside: there was nothing else left to be. Then I say it, like these pages, or how they would love me for hosting them. The earliest people feared them, and subsequent ones deny the dead. Why would I be afraid of all the people dead and martyred? I thought you were talking about words. You knew I wasn’t.Dido who had to be delivered from the wrong story:I want you to know I’m no longer left over. What about ourlibrary, nothing good left there? I want to read the fashion of when youwere old a long time ago. Gothic roses in the type; I’m an ancientHad read every the book of before they arrested me.I had crossed the black plain, I had held tears it was abruptto be walked in a herd pushing us, wherever we went to be shot, orexecuted in the earlier style. It is a timeless death placed next to themost beat-up books. Only a book can love me now. We’re readingwithout real eyes; I’ve read everything too, or in the tradition oftelling it is repeated within you what we did. We must havebeen trying to make something as we are now, but why. Youhave the ear for it. The light wants you to reply, asking if ashore had been attained or if the language were Dutch or SwahiliI didn’t know. It is how you raised the ground, like raising a childevery word that comes out of my mouth torn I’m responsible toThe wind foul pieces here tries to turn me from tenderness, the waythey killed us in the center of the city, that night. The bodiesfloated in the river while I looked for other souls and saw my facewater damaged a new texture and how can I see? Potentialreturning within its white petals and central whorl.He couldn’t believe someone would hate and betray. Itold him, but he refused to believe it; then I left the room.This lace has to be made. Treason said the ghoul thatpeculiar invention betrayal, how primal was that?In Hesiod after the light, after chaos and lover. Said the armlesswoman, said the one cut open, said the smallpoxedthe strewn children their bodies woven into the pageso I could find what they thought, even if babies only cry.Those are the bodies when I was no longer alive but upliftedbutterfly of lace with an empty length to bifurcate my symmetry.No I don’t believe the lies of the live. I am a spot of light inorder to find out, hanging on because it wasn’t revealed indeath. I know what happened to me, she said; bleeding Ilay there unblessed. Do I want a blessing now, or a god torebuild me? We have gone beyond god or new lives, or death, ortribes. I am working on this lace light at present; I accept thedrop of sacrificial blood to propitiate me. One piece of you at a timeis all I need. I am letting you feed, I say, because I know this hasalways been. You’ve been telling me for yearsWe needed you, if no one else did. We have this project tochange our silence into the beautiful city of a voice."

just arrived, has always only just departed, only just deported, did you don a suit and loiter on the highway your hands gripping a giant gilt-framed photograph of him and what questions did you interview at all who passed those vampires and angels you encountered, can you state for the record the moan you heard the ghosts emit across the nation-state,,, wuaahh buu,,, did you perform three miracles for a virile hag a witch with universes for eyes and did you request in barter a single boon his location or did you unlock his location using a skeleton, are we all a line assembled from white keys of death and is this song the sonata we hear when we press those keys, was your tool to search for him a wishbone, did you slice the wishbone from the breast of a monstrous old god, who was the god, what was his username, was it one of the ghost-giants you fled from terrified that he may have glimpsed even a shred of you, was it the famished god who grabs small ghosts to its mouth and slurps down their marrow, was it a devourer whose fingerprints leak out red tears in hysterical shame, was it Francisco Pizarro, was it King Leopold, did you see Joe Arpaio levitating each leg borne aloft by flying police cars, did you see Winston Churchill that infant-faced faminist turning loose new Emergencies, was it Andrew Jackson mounting a scorpion across that moist trail this pilgrimage for creating new ghosts, did the ghosts cry out wwuu wah,,,,,,,,, how did you kill the god, is revolutionary politics the name for deicide,, a wa wa,,,, is the translation for that moan “god grief!” did you slay the god with smallpox or pistols, hemlock or Maxim, London debt or land grants or fantasies or plague blankets or kryptonite, was it patricide, did you pry your fingers into his rib cage, did you hold the bone’s moist handles up into the sky and poke that plump cloud with your dowsing rod, did the stick sniff out your father from this city of ghosts until this wet rod twitched, until the witching stick tugged you through hell’s alleyways, until you arrived here at this modest house, what category of building is the house that contains your father, until you found a prison, until you found a shadowless space where he waited underneath a star, is death the story of until, is death the story you came to untell, did the light emit a silence like hssssssshs, this light the star wept—was it a message from the past strewn across black heaven, an emergency beacon from a plague universe calling help help from masters and money, what sound do you hear arrayed against you (here the ghost chorus leaps and screams keke keke!), did the star halt above that house like a police chopper spotlight, basking its blue heat on your skin, was this when the star’s strange beams obliterated your shadow, did you cry no please my shadow is all I have here, did you say without my shadow I am a ghost, without my shadow I have no history, how did you feel when the star cried and wailed down its weep-light in fragile pink lineaments, did you see the star throned above where your father may be waiting, is your father the king who sleeps in a cave beneath the city or does his life continue in this mute house, is he washing the dishes as we speak, is he talking on the phone in that loud way of his, is he watching a K-Drama while eating 牛 肉 麵, did he clip the soup’s recipe from that most authentic of sources Gourmet magazine, had you bought him the subscription for his birthday and was his reply to you months later, “Fine, these French can cook but take away butter and they don’t know how to do anything,” (hahahahaha say the ghosts) was that many years ago now in fact probably a decade, did you just glance down at your wristwatch to show how many days are left in your very own life, do the manic watch hands ratchet around like helicopter blades chuh chuh chuh, were you given this watch from your future self that renegade timelord, do you have the time, is time something one can possess or does it soar away from us on outspread wings, but doesn’t Dōgen say that time does not fly since it does not exist outside of us, is it impossible to exist outside the underworld, did you open the front door to the house and see the living room from your childhood, the white Naugahyde couch preserving the dark halo that he cast when he dozed off during his hair dye, the cubic light of a TV luminous solely from VHF, and framed by the window: a blue Honda, car of his youth!,,, these nostalgic recreations do they make you wonder if you had somehow time traveled to a coordinate outside of the underworld, traveled to the past, or would it be more accurate to say that we are already inside the underworld, that the apocalypse is not a spectacle but what elapses as we speak, what does it mean to speak,, ha ha blah blah blah,,,, did you tour the house of memory saying nothing, did you find the doors to each room shut, all handles locked, is this how your waking brain prohibits all fantasies, is it true that they have outlawed dreams, who is they, did you come to your bedroom door and open your wallet to take out your key, did you see on a dollar the face of an evil god, did Andrew Jackson wink at you from the currency and bare his fangs hsss sa sa,,,,,,, was this when the five dollar bill singed you, did the sign of the apocalyptic populist ignite and burn out the grooves from your fingerprints, how loud did you holler shocked, did your wallet keep falling into the floor and never stop, did the floor wobble like a trampoline, did a menacing voice laugh and say on god’s intercom here is your shadow catch, did you fall through the hole in the carpet, did you land in one of the old sewers and in the distance see someone sleeping on a stone slab, was it a body curled to the side uncovered by any blanket, did you talk on the phone with the woman from the ambulance, was it true that your sister and your stepmother saw his body covered only with a sheet, did the woman tell you what she had seen and do you remember telling her “You have a terrible job—you must tell everyone that the one they love has died,” did you recognize her when you entered this place and saw the Recording Angel, is the occupation of that archivist of prayers: writer, did the sleeping figure roll back as though on an airport conveyer, do the walls of the cave inch closer to strangle you, is the underworld a prison since those who enter it have no right to return, who will rescue you, who will rescue you now that you have lathered yourself with cave, is it true that you have forgotten how to breathe, did you aspire to be as breathless as the ghosts who populate this place or did you just have a bad day, would you like to stop, would you like to stop and catch your breath huh huhh huh, did you simultaneously call your expression narcissism and your restraint self-loathing, doubly self-damning, have you been given permission to forgive yourself, shall you ask the mirror Uncle what ails thee, what about your dowsing rod, will you wish for water, wish for air, witch for heir, did you tap your bone wand to the gray rocks repressing you, did the earth and its baroque caverns transpire into the simple night about you, did you look down through the wind from a ship sailing dark heights, did you find the ship’s steadiness strange given that nothing supported you above sky and city, well is the air nothing, was it the Maya who said that soul was simply breath, is the soul nothing, what if you crept into the airship’s spacious caverns and saw not helium but a palace of flowers, what if the entire vessel had been borne up by the exhalations of flowers their breath tasting sweet into the air, what if this was the world, what if you lived on a planet that had grown itself from the souls of flowers, did you once believe that grief was the philosopher’s stone whose touch silenced all spacetime into dark matter, on Sunday did you meet a man at the market who had returned to Haiti the day before the earthquake, did he tell you what that taught him, was the lesson to quit his job and love his daughter and begin afresh, did he remind you that you imagine the world for your child, is the poet what we name the vocation of love and freedom, on that first summer day in March did your child’s grandparents text you Christos Anesti, did you sit yourself down in the airship’s aisles unsuspended by clouds and float in the silver air, buoyed by nothing so magical as resurrection, did you take a deep breath and accept an in-flight complimentary beverage, did you gaze out the window at the spill of stars and think no not stars, the lights of the city, each one lit by a soul below?"

The alien learns quickly, and soon the rhyme scheme and refrain are being applied to whatever it encounters: moonlight filling a green bucket by the door, a dog’s tooth in furniture, the sound of a nail gun. You go to bed and dream of planets disappearing like balls in a perfect snooker clearance. In the morning you find the walls papered with villanelles, each one signed by what appears to be a bar code. When you scan one with your phone, the screen lights up with footage of a satellite flyby through the heliosphere, trailing the sound of whale song, children crying, sustained applause, and Blind Willie Johnson’s “Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground.”"

        "poem": "St. Agnes' Eve—Ah, bitter chill it was! The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold; The hare limp'd trembling through the frozen grass, And silent was the flock in woolly fold: Numb were the Beadsman's fingers, while he told His rosary, and while his frosted breath, Like pious incense from a censer old, Seem'd taking flight for heaven, without a death, Past the sweet Virgin's picture, while his prayer he saith. His prayer he saith, this patient, holy man; Then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees, And back returneth, meagre, barefoot, wan, Along the chapel aisle by slow degrees: The sculptur'd dead, on each side, seem to freeze, Emprison'd in black, purgatorial rails: Knights, ladies, praying in dumb orat'ries, He passeth by; and his weak spirit fails To think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails. Northward he turneth through a little door, And scarce three steps, ere Music's golden tongue Flatter'd to tears this aged man and poor; But no—already had his deathbell rung; The joys of all his life were said and sung: His was harsh penance on St. Agnes' Eve: Another way he went, and soon among Rough ashes sat he for his soul's reprieve, And all night kept awake, for sinners' sake to grieve. That ancient Beadsman heard the prelude soft; And so it chanc'd, for many a door was wide, From hurry to and fro. Soon, up aloft, The silver, snarling trumpets 'gan to chide: The level chambers, ready with their pride, Were glowing to receive a thousand guests: The carved angels, ever eager-eyed, Star'd, where upon their heads the cornice rests, With hair blown back, and wings put cross-wise on their breasts. At length burst in the argent revelry, With plume, tiara, and all rich array, Numerous as shadows haunting faerily The brain, new stuff'd, in youth, with triumphs gay Of old romance. These let us wish away, And turn, sole-thoughted, to one Lady there, Whose heart had brooded, all that wintry day, On love, and wing'd St. Agnes' saintly care, As she had heard old dames full many times declare. They told her how, upon St. Agnes' Eve, Young virgins might have visions of delight, And soft adorings from their loves receive Upon the honey'd middle of the night, If ceremonies due they did aright; As, supperless to bed they must retire, And couch supine their beauties, lily white; Nor look behind, nor sideways, but require Of Heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire. Full of this whim was thoughtful Madeline: The music, yearning like a God in pain, She scarcely heard: her maiden eyes divine, Fix'd on the floor, saw many a sweeping train Pass by—she heeded not at all: in vain Came many a tiptoe, amorous cavalier, And back retir'd; not cool'd by high disdain, But she saw not: her heart was otherwhere: She sigh'd for Agnes' dreams, the sweetest of the year. She danc'd along with vague, regardless eyes, Anxious her lips, her breathing quick and short: The hallow'd hour was near at hand: she sighs Amid the timbrels, and the throng'd resort Of whisperers in anger, or in sport; 'Mid looks of love, defiance, hate, and scorn, Hoodwink'd with faery fancy; all amort, Save to St. Agnes and her lambs unshorn, And all the bliss to be before to-morrow morn. So, purposing each moment to retire, She linger'd still. Meantime, across the moors, Had come young Porphyro, with heart on fire For Madeline. Beside the portal doors, Buttress'd from moonlight, stands he, and implores All saints to give him sight of Madeline, But for one moment in the tedious hours, That he might gaze and worship all unseen; Perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss—in sooth such things have been. He ventures in: let no buzz'd whisper tell: All eyes be muffled, or a hundred swords Will storm his heart, Love's fev'rous citadel: For him, those chambers held barbarian hordes, Hyena foemen, and hot-blooded lords, Whose very dogs would execrations howl Against his lineage: not one breast affords Him any mercy, in that mansion foul, Save one old beldame, weak in body and in soul. Ah, happy chance! the aged creature came, Shuffling along with ivory-headed wand, To where he stood, hid from the torch's flame, Behind a broad half-pillar, far beyond The sound of merriment and chorus bland: He startled her; but soon she knew his face, And grasp'd his fingers in her palsied hand, Saying, \"Mercy, Porphyro! hie thee from this place; They are all here to-night, the whole blood-thirsty race! \"Get hence! get hence! there's dwarfish Hildebrand; He had a fever late, and in the fit He cursed thee and thine, both house and land: Then there's that old Lord Maurice, not a whit More tame for his gray hairs—Alas me! flit! Flit like a ghost away.\"—\"Ah, Gossip dear, We're safe enough; here in this arm-chair sit, And tell me how\"—\"Good Saints! not here, not here; Follow me, child, or else these stones will be thy bier.\" He follow'd through a lowly arched way, Brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume, And as she mutter'd \"Well-a—well-a-day!\" He found him in a little moonlight room, Pale, lattic'd, chill, and silent as a tomb. \"Now tell me where is Madeline,\" said he, \"O tell me, Angela, by the holy loom Which none but secret sisterhood may see, When they St. Agnes' wool are weaving piously.\" \"St. Agnes! Ah! it is St. Agnes' Eve— Yet men will murder upon holy days: Thou must hold water in a witch's sieve, And be liege-lord of all the Elves and Fays, To venture so: it fills me with amaze To see thee, Porphyro!—St. Agnes' Eve! God's help! my lady fair the conjuror plays This very night: good angels her deceive! But let me laugh awhile, I've mickle time to grieve.\" Feebly she laugheth in the languid moon, While Porphyro upon her face doth look, Like puzzled urchin on an aged crone Who keepeth clos'd a wond'rous riddle-book, As spectacled she sits in chimney nook. But soon his eyes grew brilliant, when she told His lady's purpose; and he scarce could brook Tears, at the thought of those enchantments cold, And Madeline asleep in lap of legends old. Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose, Flushing his brow, and in his pained heart Made purple riot: then doth he propose A stratagem, that makes the beldame start: \"A cruel man and impious thou art: Sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, and dream Alone with her good angels, far apart From wicked men like thee. Go, go!—I deem Thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem.\" \"I will not harm her, by all saints I swear,\" Quoth Porphyro: \"O may I ne'er find grace When my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer, If one of her soft ringlets I displace, Or look with ruffian passion in her face: Good Angela, believe me by these tears; Or I will, even in a moment's space, Awake, with horrid shout, my foemen's ears, And beard them, though they be more fang'd than wolves and bears.\" \"Ah! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul? A poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing, Whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll; Whose prayers for thee, each morn and evening, Were never miss'd.\"—Thus plaining, doth she bring A gentler speech from burning Porphyro; So woful, and of such deep sorrowing, That Angela gives promise she will do Whatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe. Which was, to lead him, in close secrecy, Even to Madeline's chamber, and there hide Him in a closet, of such privacy That he might see her beauty unespy'd, And win perhaps that night a peerless bride, While legion'd faeries pac'd the coverlet, And pale enchantment held her sleepy-ey'd. Never on such a night have lovers met, Since Merlin paid his Demon all the monstrous debt. \"It shall be as thou wishest,\" said the Dame: \"All cates and dainties shall be stored there Quickly on this feast-night: by the tambour frame Her own lute thou wilt see: no time to spare, For I am slow and feeble, and scarce dare On such a catering trust my dizzy head. Wait here, my child, with patience; kneel in prayer The while: Ah! thou must needs the lady wed, Or may I never leave my grave among the dead.\" So saying, she hobbled off with busy fear. The lover's endless minutes slowly pass'd; The dame return'd, and whisper'd in his ear To follow her; with aged eyes aghast From fright of dim espial. Safe at last, Through many a dusky gallery, they gain The maiden's chamber, silken, hush'd, and chaste; Where Porphyro took covert, pleas'd amain. His poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain. Her falt'ring hand upon the balustrade, Old Angela was feeling for the stair, When Madeline, St. Agnes' charmed maid, Rose, like a mission'd spirit, unaware: With silver taper's light, and pious care, She turn'd, and down the aged gossip led To a safe level matting. Now prepare, Young Porphyro, for gazing on that bed; She comes, she comes again, like ring-dove fray'd and fled. Out went the taper as she hurried in; Its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died: She clos'd the door, she panted, all akin To spirits of the air, and visions wide: No uttered syllable, or, woe betide! But to her heart, her heart was voluble, Paining with eloquence her balmy side; As though a tongueless nightingale should swell Her throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled, in her dell. A casement high and triple-arch'd there was, All garlanded with carven imag'ries Of fruits, and flowers, and bunches of knot-grass, And diamonded with panes of quaint device, Innumerable of stains and splendid dyes, As are the tiger-moth's deep-damask'd wings; And in the midst, 'mong thousand heraldries, And twilight saints, and dim emblazonings, A shielded scutcheon blush'd with blood of queens and kings. Full on this casement shone the wintry moon, And threw warm gules on Madeline's fair breast, As down she knelt for heaven's grace and boon; Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest, And on her silver cross soft amethyst, And on her hair a glory, like a saint: She seem'd a splendid angel, newly drest, Save wings, for heaven:—Porphyro grew faint: She knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint. Anon his heart revives: her vespers done, Of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees; Unclasps her warmed jewels one by one; Loosens her fragrant boddice; by degrees Her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees: Half-hidden, like a mermaid in sea-weed, Pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees, In fancy, fair St. Agnes in her bed, But dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled. Soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest, In sort of wakeful swoon, perplex'd she lay, Until the poppied warmth of sleep oppress'd Her soothed limbs, and soul fatigued away; Flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day; Blissfully haven'd both from joy and pain; Clasp'd like a missal where swart Paynims pray; Blinded alike from sunshine and from rain, As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again. Stol'n to this paradise, and so entranced, Porphyro gaz'd upon her empty dress, And listen'd to her breathing, if it chanced To wake into a slumberous tenderness; Which when he heard, that minute did he bless, And breath'd himself: then from the closet crept, Noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness, And over the hush'd carpet, silent, stept, And 'tween the curtains peep'd, where, lo!—how fast she slept. Then by the bed-side, where the faded moon Made a dim, silver twilight, soft he set A table, and, half anguish'd, threw thereon A cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet:— O for some drowsy Morphean amulet! The boisterous, midnight, festive clarion, The kettle-drum, and far-heard clarinet, Affray his ears, though but in dying tone:— The hall door shuts again, and all the noise is gone. And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep, In blanched linen, smooth, and lavender'd, While he forth from the closet brought a heap Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd; With jellies soother than the creamy curd, And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon; Manna and dates, in argosy transferr'd From Fez; and spiced dainties, every one, From silken Samarcand to cedar'd Lebanon. These delicates he heap'd with glowing hand On golden dishes and in baskets bright Of wreathed silver: sumptuous they stand In the retired quiet of the night, Filling the chilly room with perfume light.— \"And now, my love, my seraph fair, awake! Thou art my heaven, and I thine eremite: Open thine eyes, for meek St. Agnes' sake, Or I shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache.\" Thus whispering, his warm, unnerved arm Sank in her pillow. Shaded was her dream By the dusk curtains:—'twas a midnight charm Impossible to melt as iced stream: The lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam; Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies: It seem'd he never, never could redeem From such a stedfast spell his lady's eyes; So mus'd awhile, entoil'd in woofed phantasies. Awakening up, he took her hollow lute,— Tumultuous,—and, in chords that tenderest be, He play'd an ancient ditty, long since mute, In Provence call'd, \"La belle dame sans mercy\": Close to her ear touching the melody;— Wherewith disturb'd, she utter'd a soft moan: He ceas'd—she panted quick—and suddenly Her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone: Upon his knees he sank, pale as smooth-sculptured stone. Her eyes were open, but she still beheld, Now wide awake, the vision of her sleep: There was a painful change, that nigh expell'd The blisses of her dream so pure and deep At which fair Madeline began to weep, And moan forth witless words with many a sigh; While still her gaze on Porphyro would keep; Who knelt, with joined hands and piteous eye, Fearing to move or speak, she look'd so dreamingly. \"Ah, Porphyro!\" said she, \"but even now Thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear, Made tuneable with every sweetest vow; And those sad eyes were spiritual and clear: How chang'd thou art! how pallid, chill, and drear! Give me that voice again, my Porphyro, Those looks immortal, those complainings dear! Oh leave me not in this eternal woe, For if thy diest, my Love, I know not where to go.\" Beyond a mortal man impassion'd far At these voluptuous accents, he arose Ethereal, flush'd, and like a throbbing star Seen mid the sapphire heaven's deep repose; Into her dream he melted, as the rose Blendeth its odour with the violet,— Solution sweet: meantime the frost-wind blows Like Love's alarum pattering the sharp sleet Against the window-panes; St. Agnes' moon hath set. 'Tis dark: quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet: \"This is no dream, my bride, my Madeline!\" 'Tis dark: the iced gusts still rave and beat: \"No dream, alas! alas! and woe is mine! Porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine.— Cruel! what traitor could thee hither bring? I curse not, for my heart is lost in thine, Though thou forsakest a deceived thing;— A dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing.\" \"My Madeline! sweet dreamer! lovely bride! Say, may I be for aye thy vassal blest? Thy beauty's shield, heart-shap'd and vermeil dyed? Ah, silver shrine, here will I take my rest After so many hours of toil and quest, A famish'd pilgrim,—sav'd by miracle. Though I have found, I will not rob thy nest Saving of thy sweet self; if thou think'st well To trust, fair Madeline, to no rude infidel. \"Hark! 'tis an elfin-storm from faery land, Of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed: Arise—arise! the morning is at hand;— The bloated wassaillers will never heed:— Let us away, my love, with happy speed; There are no ears to hear, or eyes to see,— Drown'd all in Rhenish and the sleepy mead: Awake! arise! my love, and fearless be, For o'er the southern moors I have a home for thee.\" She hurried at his words, beset with fears, For there were sleeping dragons all around, At glaring watch, perhaps, with ready spears— Down the wide stairs a darkling way they found.— In all the house was heard no human sound. A chain-droop'd lamp was flickering by each door; The arras, rich with horseman, hawk, and hound, Flutter'd in the besieging wind's uproar; And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor. They glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall; Like phantoms, to the iron porch, they glide; Where lay the Porter, in uneasy sprawl, With a huge empty flaggon by his side: The wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide, But his sagacious eye an inmate owns: By one, and one, the bolts full easy slide:— The chains lie silent on the footworn stones;— The key turns, and the door upon its hinges groans. And they are gone: ay, ages long ago These lovers fled away into the storm. That night the Baron dreamt of many a woe, And all his warrior-guests, with shade and form Of witch, and demon, and large coffin-worm, Were long be-nightmar'd. Angela the old Died palsy-twitch'd, with meagre face deform; The Beadsman, after thousand aves told, For aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold."

Noted by John Barnard in John Keats: The Complete Poems (Penguin, 2003). I set her on my pacing steed, And nothing else saw all day long, For sidelong would she bend, and sing A faery’s song. She found me roots of relish sweet, And honey wild, and manna-dewhoney wild, and manna-dew Echoes manna in the Bible, first described in Exodus, 16:14-21, 31. The Israelites eat the manna, a food miraculously supplied in the wilderness after the dew has lifted, in the morning: “The house of Israel called it manna; it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey” (Exodus 16:31, NRSV)., And sure in language strange she said— ‘I love thee true’.

        "poem": "Morning and evening\nMaids heard the goblins cry:\n“Come buy our orchard fruits,\nCome buy, come buy:\nApples and quinces,\nLemons and oranges,\nPlump unpeck’d cherries,\nMelons and raspberries,\nBloom-down-cheek’d peaches,\nSwart-headed mulberries,\nWild free-born cranberries,\nCrab-apples, dewberries,\nPine-apples, blackberries,\nApricots, strawberries;—\nAll ripe together\nIn summer weather,—\nMorns that pass by,\nFair eves that fly;\nCome buy, come buy:\nOur grapes fresh from the vine,\nPomegranates full and fine,\nDates and sharp bullaces,\nRare pears and greengages,\nDamsons and bilberries,\nTaste them and try:\nCurrants and gooseberries,\nBright-fire-like barberries,\nFigs to fill your mouth,\nCitrons from the South,\nSweet to tongue and sound to eye;\nCome buy, come buy.”\n\nEvening by evening\nAmong the brookside rushes,\nLaura bow’d her head to hear,\nLizzie veil’d her blushes:\nCrouching close together\nIn the cooling weather,\nWith clasping arms and cautioning lips,\nWith tingling cheeks and finger tips.\n“Lie close,” Laura said,\nPricking up her golden head:\n“We must not look at goblin men,\nWe must not buy their fruits:\nWho knows upon what soil they fed\nTheir hungry thirsty roots?”\n“Come buy,” call the goblins\nHobbling down the glen.\n“Oh,” cried Lizzie, “Laura, Laura,\nYou should not peep at goblin men.”\nLizzie cover’d up her eyes,\nCover’d close lest they should look;\nLaura rear’d her glossy head,\nAnd whisper’d like the restless brook:\n“Look, Lizzie, look, Lizzie,\nDown the glen tramp little men.\nOne hauls a basket,\nOne bears a plate,\nOne lugs a golden dish\nOf many pounds weight.\nHow fair the vine must grow\nWhose grapes are so luscious;\nHow warm the wind must blow\nThrough those fruit bushes.”\n“No,” said Lizzie, “No, no, no;\nTheir offers should not charm us,\nTheir evil gifts would harm us.”\nShe thrust a dimpled finger\nIn each ear, shut eyes and ran:\nCurious Laura chose to linger\nWondering at each merchant man.\nOne had a cat’s face,\nOne whisk’d a tail,\nOne tramp’d at a rat’s pace,\nOne crawl’d like a snail,\nOne like a wombat prowl’d obtuse and furry,\nOne like a ratel tumbled hurry skurry.\nShe heard a voice like voice of doves\nCooing all together:\nThey sounded kind and full of loves\nIn the pleasant weather.\n\nLaura stretch’d her gleaming neck\nLike a rush-imbedded swan,\nLike a lily from the beck,\nLike a moonlit poplar branch,\nLike a vessel at the launch\nWhen its last restraint is gone.\n\nBackwards up the mossy glen\nTurn’d and troop’d the goblin men,\nWith their shrill repeated cry,\n“Come buy, come buy.”\nWhen they reach’d where Laura was\nThey stood stock still upon the moss,\nLeering at each other,\nBrother with queer brother;\nSignalling each other,\nBrother with sly brother.\nOne set his basket down,\nOne rear’d his plate;\nOne began to weave a crown\nOf tendrils, leaves, and rough nuts brown\n(Men sell not such in any town);\nOne heav’d the golden weight\nOf dish and fruit to offer her:\n“Come buy, come buy,” was still their cry.\nLaura stared but did not stir,\nLong’d but had no money:\nThe whisk-tail’d merchant bade her taste\nIn tones as smooth as honey,\nThe cat-faced purr’d,\nThe rat-faced spoke a word\nOf welcome, and the snail-paced even was heard;\nOne parrot-voiced and jolly\nCried “Pretty Goblin” still for “Pretty Polly;”—\nOne whistled like a bird.\n\nBut sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:\n“Good folk, I have no coin;\nTo take were to purloin:\nI have no copper in my purse,\nI have no silver either,\nAnd all my gold is on the furze\nThat shakes in windy weather\nAbove the rusty heather.”\n“You have much gold upon your head,”\nThey answer’d all together:\n“Buy from us with a golden curl.”\nShe clipp’d a precious golden lock,\nShe dropp’d a tear more rare than pearl,\nThen suck’d their fruit globes fair or red:\nSweeter than honey from the rock,\nStronger than man-rejoicing wine,\nClearer than water flow’d that juice;\nShe never tasted such before,\nHow should it cloy with length of use?\nShe suck’d and suck’d and suck’d the more\nFruits which that unknown orchard bore;\nShe suck’d until her lips were sore;\nThen flung the emptied rinds away\nBut gather’d up one kernel stone,\nAnd knew not was it night or day\nAs she turn’d home alone.\n\nLizzie met her at the gate\nFull of wise upbraidings:\n“Dear, you should not stay so late,\nTwilight is not good for maidens;\nShould not loiter in the glen\nIn the haunts of goblin men.\nDo you not remember Jeanie,\nHow she met them in the moonlight,\nTook their gifts both choice and many,\nAte their fruits and wore their flowers\nPluck’d from bowers\nWhere summer ripens at all hours?\nBut ever in the noonlight\nShe pined and pined away;\nSought them by night and day,\nFound them no more, but dwindled and grew grey;\nThen fell with the first snow,\nWhile to this day no grass will grow\nWhere she lies low:\nI planted daisies there a year ago\nThat never blow.\nYou should not loiter so.”\n“Nay, hush,” said Laura:\n“Nay, hush, my sister:\nI ate and ate my fill,\nYet my mouth waters still;\nTo-morrow night I will\nBuy more;” and kiss’d her:\n“Have done with sorrow;\nI’ll bring you plums to-morrow\nFresh on their mother twigs,\nCherries worth getting;\nYou cannot think what figs\nMy teeth have met in,\nWhat melons icy-cold\nPiled on a dish of gold\nToo huge for me to hold,\nWhat peaches with a velvet nap,\nPellucid grapes without one seed:\nOdorous indeed must be the mead\nWhereon they grow, and pure the wave they drink\nWith lilies at the brink,\nAnd sugar-sweet their sap.”\n\nGolden head by golden head,\nLike two pigeons in one nest\nFolded in each other’s wings,\nThey lay down in their curtain’d bed:\nLike two blossoms on one stem,\nLike two flakes of new-fall’n snow,\nLike two wands of ivory\nTipp’d with gold for awful kings.\nMoon and stars gaz’d in at them,\nWind sang to them lullaby,\nLumbering owls forbore to fly,\nNot a bat flapp’d to and fro\nRound their rest:\nCheek to cheek and breast to breast\nLock’d together in one nest.\n\nEarly in the morning\nWhen the first cock crow’d his warning,\nNeat like bees, as sweet and busy,\nLaura rose with Lizzie:\nFetch’d in honey, milk’d the cows,\nAir’d and set to rights the house,\nKneaded cakes of whitest wheat,\nCakes for dainty mouths to eat,\nNext churn’d butter, whipp’d up cream,\nFed their poultry, sat and sew’d;\nTalk’d as modest maidens should:\nLizzie with an open heart,\nLaura in an absent dream,\nOne content, one sick in part;\nOne warbling for the mere bright day’s delight,\nOne longing for the night.\n\nAt length slow evening came:\nThey went with pitchers to the reedy brook;\nLizzie most placid in her look,\nLaura most like a leaping flame.\nThey drew the gurgling water from its deep;\nLizzie pluck’d purple and rich golden flags,\nThen turning homeward said: “The sunset flushes\nThose furthest loftiest crags;\nCome, Laura, not another maiden lags.\nNo wilful squirrel wags,\nThe beasts and birds are fast asleep.”\nBut Laura loiter’d still among the rushes\nAnd said the bank was steep.\n\nAnd said the hour was early still\nThe dew not fall’n, the wind not chill;\nListening ever, but not catching\nThe customary cry,\n“Come buy, come buy,”\nWith its iterated jingle\nOf sugar-baited words:\nNot for all her watching\nOnce discerning even one goblin\nRacing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;\nLet alone the herds\nThat used to tramp along the glen,\nIn groups or single,\nOf brisk fruit-merchant men.\n\nTill Lizzie urged, “O Laura, come;\nI hear the fruit-call but I dare not look:\nYou should not loiter longer at this brook:\nCome with me home.\nThe stars rise, the moon bends her arc,\nEach glowworm winks her spark,\nLet us get home before the night grows dark:\nFor clouds may gather\nThough this is summer weather,\nPut out the lights and drench us through;\nThen if we lost our way what should we do?”\n\nLaura turn’d cold as stone\nTo find her sister heard that cry alone,\nThat goblin cry,\n“Come buy our fruits, come buy.”\nMust she then buy no more such dainty fruit?\nMust she no more such succous pasture find,\nGone deaf and blind?\nHer tree of life droop’d from the root:\nShe said not one word in her heart’s sore ache;\nBut peering thro’ the dimness, nought discerning,\nTrudg’d home, her pitcher dripping all the way;\nSo crept to bed, and lay\nSilent till Lizzie slept;\nThen sat up in a passionate yearning,\nAnd gnash’d her teeth for baulk’d desire, and wept\nAs if her heart would break.\n\nDay after day, night after night,\nLaura kept watch in vain\nIn sullen silence of exceeding pain.\nShe never caught again the goblin cry:\n“Come buy, come buy;”—\nShe never spied the goblin men\nHawking their fruits along the glen:\nBut when the noon wax’d bright\nHer hair grew thin and grey;\nShe dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn\nTo swift decay and burn\nHer fire away.\n\nOne day remembering her kernel-stone\nShe set it by a wall that faced the south;\nDew’d it with tears, hoped for a root,\nWatch’d for a waxing shoot,\nBut there came none;\nIt never saw the sun,\nIt never felt the trickling moisture run:\nWhile with sunk eyes and faded mouth\nShe dream’d of melons, as a traveller sees\nFalse waves in desert drouth\nWith shade of leaf-crown’d trees,\nAnd burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.\n\nShe no more swept the house,\nTended the fowls or cows,\nFetch’d honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,\nBrought water from the brook:\nBut sat down listless in the chimney-nook\nAnd would not eat.\n\nTender Lizzie could not bear\nTo watch her sister’s cankerous care\nYet not to share.\nShe night and morning\nCaught the goblins’ cry:\n“Come buy our orchard fruits,\nCome buy, come buy;”—\nBeside the brook, along the glen,\nShe heard the tramp of goblin men,\nThe yoke and stir\nPoor Laura could not hear;\nLong’d to buy fruit to comfort her,\nBut fear’d to pay too dear.\nShe thought of Jeanie in her grave,\nWho should have been a bride;\nBut who for joys brides hope to have\nFell sick and died\nIn her gay prime,\nIn earliest winter time\nWith the first glazing rime,\nWith the first snow-fall of crisp winter time.\n\nTill Laura dwindling\nSeem’d knocking at Death’s door:\nThen Lizzie weigh’d no more\nBetter and worse;\nBut put a silver penny in her purse,\nKiss’d Laura, cross’d the heath with clumps of furze\nAt twilight, halted by the brook:\nAnd for the first time in her life\nBegan to listen and look.\n\nLaugh’d every goblin\nWhen they spied her peeping:\nCame towards her hobbling,\nFlying, running, leaping,\nPuffing and blowing,\nChuckling, clapping, crowing,\nClucking and gobbling,\nMopping and mowing,\nFull of airs and graces,\nPulling wry faces,\nDemure grimaces,\nCat-like and rat-like,\nRatel- and wombat-like,\nSnail-paced in a hurry,\nParrot-voiced and whistler,\nHelter skelter, hurry skurry,\nChattering like magpies,\nFluttering like pigeons,\nGliding like fishes,—\nHugg’d her and kiss’d her:\nSqueez’d and caress’d her:\nStretch’d up their dishes,\nPanniers, and plates:\n“Look at our apples\nRusset and dun,\nBob at our cherries,\nBite at our peaches,\nCitrons and dates,\nGrapes for the asking,\nPears red with basking\nOut in the sun,\nPlums on their twigs;\nPluck them and suck them,\nPomegranates, figs.”—\n\n“Good folk,” said Lizzie,\nMindful of Jeanie:\n“Give me much and many: —\nHeld out her apron,\nToss’d them her penny.\n“Nay, take a seat with us,\nHonour and eat with us,”\nThey answer’d grinning:\n“Our feast is but beginning.\nNight yet is early,\nWarm and dew-pearly,\nWakeful and starry:\nSuch fruits as these\nNo man can carry:\nHalf their bloom would fly,\nHalf their dew would dry,\nHalf their flavour would pass by.\nSit down and feast with us,\nBe welcome guest with us,\nCheer you and rest with us.”—\n“Thank you,” said Lizzie: “But one waits\nAt home alone for me:\nSo without further parleying,\nIf you will not sell me any\nOf your fruits though much and many,\nGive me back my silver penny\nI toss’d you for a fee.”—\nThey began to scratch their pates,\nNo longer wagging, purring,\nBut visibly demurring,\nGrunting and snarling.\nOne call’d her proud,\nCross-grain’d, uncivil;\nTheir tones wax’d loud,\nTheir looks were evil.\nLashing their tails\nThey trod and hustled her,\nElbow’d and jostled her,\nClaw’d with their nails,\nBarking, mewing, hissing, mocking,\nTore her gown and soil’d her stocking,\nTwitch’d her hair out by the roots,\nStamp’d upon her tender feet,\nHeld her hands and squeez’d their fruits\nAgainst her mouth to make her eat.\n\nWhite and golden Lizzie stood,\nLike a lily in a flood,—\nLike a rock of blue-vein’d stone\nLash’d by tides obstreperously,—\nLike a beacon left alone\nIn a hoary roaring sea,\nSending up a golden fire,—\nLike a fruit-crown’d orange-tree\nWhite with blossoms honey-sweet\nSore beset by wasp and bee,—\nLike a royal virgin town\nTopp’d with gilded dome and spire\nClose beleaguer’d by a fleet\nMad to tug her standard down.\n\nOne may lead a horse to water,\nTwenty cannot make him drink.\nThough the goblins cuff’d and caught her,\nCoax’d and fought her,\nBullied and besought her,\nScratch’d her, pinch’d her black as ink,\nKick’d and knock’d her,\nMaul’d and mock’d her,\nLizzie utter’d not a word;\nWould not open lip from lip\nLest they should cram a mouthful in:\nBut laugh’d in heart to feel the drip\nOf juice that syrupp’d all her face,\nAnd lodg’d in dimples of her chin,\nAnd streak’d her neck which quaked like curd.\nAt last the evil people,\nWorn out by her resistance,\nFlung back her penny, kick’d their fruit\nAlong whichever road they took,\nNot leaving root or stone or shoot;\nSome writh’d into the ground,\nSome div’d into the brook\nWith ring and ripple,\nSome scudded on the gale without a sound,\nSome vanish’d in the distance.\n\nIn a smart, ache, tingle,\nLizzie went her way;\nKnew not was it night or day;\nSprang up the bank, tore thro’ the furze,\nThreaded copse and dingle,\nAnd heard her penny jingle\nBouncing in her purse,—\nIts bounce was music to her ear.\nShe ran and ran\nAs if she fear’d some goblin man\nDogg’d her with gibe or curse\nOr something worse:\nBut not one goblin scurried after,\nNor was she prick’d by fear;\nThe kind heart made her windy-paced\nThat urged her home quite out of breath with haste\nAnd inward laughter.\n\nShe cried, “Laura,” up the garden,\n“Did you miss me?\nCome and kiss me.\nNever mind my bruises,\nHug me, kiss me, suck my juices\nSqueez’d from goblin fruits for you,\nGoblin pulp and goblin dew.\nEat me, drink me, love me;\nLaura, make much of me;\nFor your sake I have braved the glen\nAnd had to do with goblin merchant men.”\n\nLaura started from her chair,\nFlung her arms up in the air,\nClutch’d her hair:\n“Lizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted\nFor my sake the fruit forbidden?\nMust your light like mine be hidden,\nYour young life like mine be wasted,\nUndone in mine undoing,\nAnd ruin’d in my ruin,\nThirsty, canker’d, goblin-ridden?”—\nShe clung about her sister,\nKiss’d and kiss’d and kiss’d her:\nTears once again\nRefresh’d her shrunken eyes,\nDropping like rain\nAfter long sultry drouth;\nShaking with aguish fear, and pain,\nShe kiss’d and kiss’d her with a hungry mouth.\n\nHer lips began to scorch,\nThat juice was wormwood to her tongue,\nShe loath’d the feast:\nWrithing as one possess’d she leap’d and sung,\nRent all her robe, and wrung\nHer hands in lamentable haste,\nAnd beat her breast.\nHer locks stream’d like the torch\nBorne by a racer at full speed,\nOr like the mane of horses in their flight,\nOr like an eagle when she stems the light\nStraight toward the sun,\nOr like a caged thing freed,\nOr like a flying flag when armies run.\n\nSwift fire spread through her veins, knock’d at her heart,\nMet the fire smouldering there\nAnd overbore its lesser flame;\nShe gorged on bitterness without a name:\nAh! fool, to choose such part\nOf soul-consuming care!\nSense fail’d in the mortal strife:\nLike the watch-tower of a town\nWhich an earthquake shatters down,\nLike a lightning-stricken mast,\nLike a wind-uprooted tree\nSpun about,\nLike a foam-topp’d waterspout\nCast down headlong in the sea,\nShe fell at last;\nPleasure past and anguish past,\nIs it death or is it life?\n\nLife out of death.\nThat night long Lizzie watch’d by her,\nCounted her pulse’s flagging stir,\nFelt for her breath,\nHeld water to her lips, and cool’d her face\nWith tears and fanning leaves:\nBut when the first birds chirp’d about their eaves,\nAnd early reapers plodded to the place\nOf golden sheaves,\nAnd dew-wet grass\nBow’d in the morning winds so brisk to pass,\nAnd new buds with new day\nOpen’d of cup-like lilies on the stream,\nLaura awoke as from a dream,\nLaugh’d in the innocent old way,\nHugg’d Lizzie but not twice or thrice;\nHer gleaming locks show’d not one thread of grey,\nHer breath was sweet as May\nAnd light danced in her eyes.\n\nDays, weeks, months, years\nAfterwards, when both were wives\nWith children of their own;\nTheir mother-hearts beset with fears,\nTheir lives bound up in tender lives;\nLaura would call the little ones\nAnd tell them of her early prime,\nThose pleasant days long gone\nOf not-returning time:\nWould talk about the haunted glen,\nThe wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men,\nTheir fruits like honey to the throat\nBut poison in the blood;\n(Men sell not such in any town):\nWould tell them how her sister stood\nIn deadly peril to do her good,\nAnd win the fiery antidote:\nThen joining hands to little hands\nWould bid them cling together,\n“For there is no friend like a sister\nIn calm or stormy weather;\nTo cheer one on the tedious way,\nTo fetch one if one goes astray,\nTo lift one if one totters down,\nTo strengthen whilst one stands.”"

That was a mistake.

Friends depart,\n\nTaking their last look from the roof,\n\nSaying goodnight and carrying their view\n\nOf grapes the model ate in Paris years ago.\n\nBlue in the morning, green some afternoons;\n\nThe night, ambiguous, forgets the signature.\n\nThe dust in attics settled and his stove\n\nGrew cold. About the model nothing much is known.\n\nIt ends the wall and complements the view\n\nOf chimneys. And it hides a stain.\n\n8.\n\nAnd when your beauty, washed away\n\nIn impure streams with my desire,\n\nIs only topic for ill-mannered minds,\n\nGifted and glassy with exact recall,\n\nGossip and rancid footnotes, or remote despair,\n\nLet ruined weather perish in the streets\n\nAnd let the world’s black lying flag come down.\n\nOnly in calendars that mark no Spring\n\nCan there be weather in the mind\n\nThat moves to you again as you are now:\n\nTired after love and silent in this house,\n\nYour back turned to me, quite alone,\n\nStanding with one hand raised to smooth your hair,\n\nAt a small window, green with rain."

About twelve by the moon-dial, One more filmy than the rest (A kind which, upon trial, They have found to be the best) Comes down—still down—and down With its centre on the crown Of a mountain’s eminence, While its wide circumference In easy drapery falls Over hamlets, over halls, Wherever they may be— O’er the strange woods—o’er the sea— Over spirits on the wing— Over every drowsy thing— And buries them up quite In a labyrinth of light— And then, how, deep! —O, deep, Is the passion of their sleep.

Strange, above all, thy length of tress, And this all solemn silentness! The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep, Which is enduring, so be deep! Heaven have her in its sacred keep! This chamber changed for one more holy, This bed for one more melancholy, I pray to God that she may lie Forever with unopened eye, While the pale sheeted ghosts go by! My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep, As it is lasting, so be deep! Soft may the worms about her creep! Far in the forest, dim and old, For her may some tall vault unfold— Some vault that oft hath flung its black And wingéd pannels fluttering back, Triumphant, o’er the crested palls Of her grand family funerals— Some sepulchre, remote, alone, Against whose portals she hath thrown, In childhood, many an idle stone— Some tomb from out whose sounding door She ne’er shall force an echo more, Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!

Even they\n\nmay never stop its motion.\n\nYesterday at noon, I heard\n\nmy Cheyenne sister moan as she waded\n\nthrough deep snow before soldiers\n\ncut up her corpse to sell\n\nas souvenirs. Are my brothers\n\nhere? Ghosts bring all my joy.\n\nI walk this good road between rock\n\nand sky. They dare not threaten with death\n\none already dead."

        "poem": "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\n\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\n\nWhile I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\n\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\n\nOnly this and nothing more.”\n\nAh, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\n\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n\nEagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\n\nFrom my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\n\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\n\nNameless here for evermore.\n\nAnd the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\n\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\n\nSo that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n\n“’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\n\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\n\nThis it is and nothing more.”\n\nPresently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\n\nBut the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\n\nAnd so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\n\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\n\nDarkness there and nothing more.\n\nDeep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\n\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\n\nBut the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\n\nAnd the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\n\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\n\nMerely this and nothing more.\n\nBack into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\n\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n\n“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\n\nLet me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\n\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n\n’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n\nOpen here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\n\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\n\nNot the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\n\nBut, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\n\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\n\nPerched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\n\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\n\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\n\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\n\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\nMuch I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\n\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\n\nFor we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\n\nEver yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\n\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n\nWith such name as “Nevermore.”\n\nBut the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\n\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\n\nNothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\n\nTill I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\n\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\n\nThen the bird said “Nevermore.”\n\nStartled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\n\nCaught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\n\nFollowed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\n\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\n\nOf ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n\nBut the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\n\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\n\nThen, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\n\nFancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\n\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n\nMeant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n\nThis I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\n\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\n\nThis and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\n\nOn the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\n\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\n\nShe shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\nThen, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\n\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n\n“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\n\nRespite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\n\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\n\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\n\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\n\nDesolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\n\nOn this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\n\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\n\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\n\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\n\nTell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\n\nIt shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\n\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\n\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\n\nLeave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\n\nLeave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\n\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\n\nQuoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\nAnd the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\n\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\n\nAnd his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\n\nAnd the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\n\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\n\nShall be lifted—nevermore!"

They love me so much, he thought, they have imagined me dead because they fear the loss of my genius above all else. So he put on his hat, combed his goatee to a waxed point, and sauntered out of his flat to attend his own funeral. How literary, he thought, like Huck Finn, and Everyone will be weeping.\n\n\nHe was perturbed, however, when he found that the funeral home was in a bad section of town, next to a tattoo parlor named The Desultory Slut. He walked in past the unmanned front desk, to a back room of frayed velvet and gilt columns, where his coffin was on display, a faux mahogany monstrosity with painted pewter handles. The only people in attendance were four young professors from the local college, with leather patches on the elbows of their ill-fitting tweed jackets and long cruel faces of foxes and rats. He recognized one of them, a gangly fellow with pimply cheeks who had shaken his hand after his last reading and reverently asked for his signature.\n\n\nDo you have one of my books to sign? the author had asked.\n\n\nOh no, the young professor had cried, baring his hairless chest, can you please sign here?\n\n\nNow the pimply fellow was sitting in a pew, whispering loudly to his neighbor, Isn’t it great, he said, The old bastard finally kicked.\n\n\nHis neighbor nodded silently.\n\n\nDeeply disturbed, but well aware of the dramatic potential of the moment, the author took this as his cue to step boldly into the room, with a loud Ta daaa!\n\n\nFor some reason, the professors ignored him, and continued their whispering.\n\n\nFor a moment, he was afflicted with a strange vertigo, and stood like a clay golem, without a will of his own. Then a sudden rage took him, and the author snapped out of the spell and strode to the front of the room, waving his arms. Wait, I’m not dead at all. Here I am. It was all a mistake, he cried.\n\n\nBut the professors did not see him. In fact one walked right through him, as if he were merely a ghost or spirit, and rushed up to the coffin. Do you realize what this means? the professor cried, This means we’re free, and he grabbed the body in the coffin and dragged it to the floor. The shocked author saw in the body his own likeness, lips and cheeks rouged into a grotesque semblance of life.\n\n\nHe’s dead, he’s dead. Our enemy is finally dead, they chanted in a frenzy and the professors began trampling on the corpse, weeping with joy and relief."

It was Roger Lawson. Roger was a practical joker of the\n\nworst sort, and up till now I had not been one of his victims, so\n\nI kind of knew my time had come. People parked in front of my\n\nhouse for hours and took pictures. I had to draw all my blinds\n\nand only went out when I had to. Then there was a barrage of\n\nquestions. “What does he look like?\" “What do you feed him?” “How\n\ndid you capture him?” And I simply denied the presence of an\n\nextraterrestrial in my house. And, of course, this excited them\n\nall the more. The press showed up and started creeping around\n\nmy yard. It got to be very irritating. More and more came and\n\nparked up and down the street. Roger was really working overtime\n\non this one. I had to do something. Finally, I made an announcement.\n\nI said, “The little fellow died peacefully in his sleep at 11:02\n\nlast night.” “Let us see the body,” they clamored. “He went up\n\nin smoke instantly,” I said. “I don’t believe you,” one of them\n\nsaid. “There is no body in the house or I would have buried it\n\nmyself,” I said. About half of them got in their cars and drove\n\noff. The rest of them kept their vigil, but more solemnly now.\n\nI went out and bought some groceries. When I came back about an\n\nhour later another half of them had gone. When I went into the kitchen\n\nI nearly dropped the groceries. There was a nearly transparent\n\nfellow with large pink eyes standing about three feet tall. “Why\n\ndid you tell them I was dead? That was a lie,” he said. “You\n\nspeak English,” I said. “I listen to the radio. It wasn’t very\n\nhard to learn. Also we have television. We get all your channels.\n\nI like cowboys, especially John Ford moviesJohn Ford movies John Ford (1894-1973) was a Hollywood director, famous for a number of movies, including cowboy movies starring John Wayne, such as “Rio Grande,” “She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,” and “Stagecoach.”. They’re the best,”\n\nhe said. “What am I going to do with you?” I said. “Take me\n\nto meet a real cowboy. That would make me happy,” he said. “I\n\ndon’t know any real cowboys, but maybe we could find one. But\n\npeople will go crazy if they see you. We’d have press following\n\nus everywhere. It would be the story of the century,” I said.\n\n“I can be invisible. It’s not hard for me to do,” he said.\n\n“I’ll think about it. Wyoming or Montana would be our best bet, but\n\nthey’re a long way from here,” I said. “Please, I won’t cause\n\nyou any trouble,” he said. “It would take some planning,” I said.\n\nI put the groceries down and started putting them away. I tried\n\nnot to think of the cosmic meaning of all this. Instead, I\n\ntreated him like a smart little kid. “Do you have any sarsaparillasarsaparilla An old-fashioned soft drink. When a character in a Western film would order a sarsaparilla in a bar, instead of an alcoholic beverage, he would be mocked by cowboys.?”\n\nhe said. “No, but I have some orange juice. It’s good for you,”\n\nI said. He drank it and made a face. “I’m going to get the maps\n\nout,” I said. “We’ll see how we could get there.” When I came\n\nback he was dancing on the kitchen table, a sort of ballet, but\n\nvery sad. “I have the maps,” I said. “We won’t need them. I just\n\nreceived word. I’m going to die tonight. It’s really a joyous\n\noccasion, and I hope you’ll help me celebrate by watching TheThe / Magnificent Seven A famous 1960 western, starring Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James CoburnMagnificent SevenThe / Magnificent Seven A famous 1960 western, starring Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn,” he said. I stood there with the maps in my\n\nhand. I felt an unbearable sadness come over me. “Why must\n\nyou die?” I said. “Father decides these things. It is probably\n\nmy reward for coming here safely and meeting you,” he said. “But\n\nI was going to take you to meet a real cowboy,” I said. “Let’s\n\npretend you are my cowboy,” he said."

        "poem": "1\n\nTaking advantage of the relationships and interaction, which actually exist between what happens\n\nto her and her desire, she creates some metaphors both obvious and opaque, as screens of rays crisscrossing\n\nthe landscape in which herself and what she expected from you in the way of support coincide,\n\nso that I and you resemble each other, now. The way they light the land like infrared without a trace\n\non film, really, part of your image was linked so closely to my desire, it remained inside my body.\n\nIt never reached the emotions, which tend to damage the body, but which memory requires.\n\nThus a formal device was discovered for detailing information that was intimate and largely unacceptable\n\nto what I thought I required from you, regarding beauty in idea and form. She expected distress\n\nto automatically bring about this beauty, like a woman’s theft of fire rope from your house,\n\nbut not her hanging in the orchard by the house. She was a stranger to you.\n\nShe was never in your consciousness. Hence she was never forgotten.\n\nShe is in you the way direct experience generates consciousness, adding the energy of its materialization.\n\nTo live another person’s biography is not the same as to live his or her life.\n\nShe constructs a story line or cluster of anecdotal details, like clothes around the body,\n\ninstruments of both defense and expansion, which give meaning to fluctuations, such as in pleasures\n\noccurring between herself and you. Her sunglasses swathed in feathers express\n\nthe contingency of a light and a space, so that the anecdote of a hanging could be utilized\n\nas colorist or combinatory data, instead of her instinct for the imaginary in which what she imagines\n\nrepresents what happens, whether or not it misrepresents it.\n\nSometimes it happens during a routine she represents by evenness of light on the land\n\nor when things usually mean nothing, like harmony in light, what happens and something to mean\n\njoin accidentally. The thing isn’t what it is, but it is like what it is.\n\nLike a fake, it doesn’t mean anything, although there is something to mean,\n\nso that her solitude is the guise of unending repetition of a hanging or her relationship with you,\n\nin which all that is to be included will find a place. This is empathy or sharing her intuition with her.\n\nYou look into someone’s eyes as if you were seeing through the face.\n\n2\n\nBecause it’s not possible to absorb more than one insight at a time,\n\nthere seems to be a contradiction between the visual or space, and the context or meaning.\n\nShe felt deep uneasiness with the image of this sunset of unnatural energy, its sinister expression\n\nof an order of impossible beauty we thought we lost, accounting for the intensity of yellow light on the hill,\n\nwhich is not a thing, and it is not a metaphor, the way your life is not a metaphor to her, or\n\nthe way intense light on the hill is a recollection en plein air, in the sense that it happened.\n\nSoon the background turns gray and the hill regains its natural color, but there are three dimensions of gray.\n\nThis is a metaphor for the fact that the hanged woman actually made contact with you, although you never knew her.\n\nThere is a link with her appearance, as with sex, or the way a name is attached to something\n\nafter naming it, by the occurrence of its name, in this case linking with the appearances\n\nor biographies of a whole parade of lovers, so what she thinks of as human help from him\n\nis no longer dependent on changing her desire for him in the present, but is a substitute for it.\n\nThe landscape is empty and it is immanent. The context of the woman in its reality\n\nmay differ from the context in which the viewer thinks about her, the element of transparency.\n\nThe way the viewer thinks about her is the way low clouds extend a landscape. The viewer\n\nis acting on the landscape in consideration that the context of the viewer distinct from the context\n\nof general human help could be a metaphor for itself.\n\nThere were yellow-leaved trees behind a screen of green ones at the edge of the orchard.\n\nThey are not a border between organization and decay of autumn trees, which are organized.\n\nThe yellow leaves around your feet have an impossible beauty that was achieved and then lost.\n\nA way you can define a woman is to remember everything the woman is not.\n\nIf you move your head fast enough, you can all of a sudden discern the whole structure\n\nof the surface of each leaf, and it links in your stomach, as with sex.\n\nIf you remember not desiring her fast enough, you can all of a sudden discern her whole body.\n\nYou can feel in your stomach the way any moment that happened and in which you think about her goes\n\na long way toward convincing you of the autonomy and pre-existence of her form.\n\n3\n\nHer concentration became a direct experience of his life, an erotic concentration.\n\nHer biography of her persistently locates the point of impact of one’s own system of representations,\n\ninsofar as vision itself is a representative operating on what she sees,\n\nand for which a particular light can represent an initial condition. Even the slightest movement\n\nof a hand or a finger is controlled and emphasized as by a spotlight of this sensitiveness,\n\nthe way repetition is a cessation of the potential for conscious experience, or death,\n\nvisiting the same places during the same seasons, at almost the same hour,\n\nso that landscape could be a simple repetition, which thrives on reproduction,\n\nin order to resolve what is happening into its own combination or name of words in the form of its time,\n\nand in order to defer the story.\n\nIn a way, her memory is a theory about how the hanged woman looked to her in the orchard,\n\nwhich she has to respect, in the sense that the landscape’s immanence is an organically developing\n\nfailure of its language to speak its content. The connection between word and idea corresponding\n\nto the landscape is retained, but the connection between the word and the landscape is lost,\n\nso the shadow of a hill stays dark during lightning. How she sees the lightning\n\nis a time lapse into the planar dimension, a hierarchy of grammar or deference\n\nby way of the word belonging to her such as lady suicide or woman suicide,\n\nbecause the woman doesn’t die in her own absence or in effigy, so that\n\nno existing philosophy and no philosopher will know soon, enough points with enough speed\n\nto handle the richness of her reconstruction of her or him for long. He starts to see\n\npatterns in the words and the patterns are pretty to him and distract him.\n\nIt is well known that lightning is attracted to body heat, a person on horseback\n\nor a large saguaro, the way a racket of birds in the morning is a kind of empathy for two people.\n\nIf we retain the belief that her image of him or her, let’s say him, is a pre-requisite for\n\ngaining consciousness of the unknown person, we suppose there is no direct channel of communication\n\nto the unknown person, with the result that facts about him or her must exit into the world,\n\nbefore a life can be perceived between the light and dark of function or the object, and desire or the image.\n\nAt any time one can turn into its opposite, like desire or a screen, and the object\n\nor her story and him, who does not so much convey an image as a background\n\nto the biography. So, he says, she must emphasize references and conditions of her own life\n\nover its memories, or what she sees of the landscape by the manner of its illumination,\n\nunless she says it is illuminated within the arms of a great cottonwood, yellow or green,\n\na faith of imaginary or real connotation repeating itself from him, like alternating current\n\nor radioactive dirt being turned up that registers on her without marking her.\n\n4\n\nHer persistent observation, even after the frost, is of each leaf coinciding with its luminousness,\n\nbecause of its structure as a lighted space and which shows brightness in idea and form,\n\nso you have to maintain your own consciousness in order not to be unconscious with me.\n\nEven if we can uniquely bridge the gap between the fact of a frost and the value\n\nof luminousness, and even though these intrinsic properties of the plant may not be what it feels.\n\nWhat it feels may be a space with pillars, so with light the space extends, as in what you believe\n\nto live with. A belief is a word-like object. You can focus your attention on it down to a point,\n\nlike desire or memory of a strong feeling. You have a certain amount of control over your feeling\n\nabout general human help by changing what you believe, which embodies the memories\n\nyour speech is empowered to represent, she says.\n\nSpace is material, but seems to open up a beyond, which is thought to defy material in its failure\n\nto speak its content. It still cues this content by links or desires, as to a form of physical appearance.\n\nTo the extent that she can reconstruct a context or pornography in her body suitable for a hanged woman,\n\na contingency is beaten back, critically. In the sense that events happening at the same time are\n\nmeaningful, but not connected, there are events which mean nothing, though there is something to mean.\n\nThis is an easy way to expect with desire from moment to moment, while the woman was hanging herself,\n\nas if consistency and the quest for certainty were not emotional,\n\nas when a person begins telling a story, leaves move.\n\nHe believed that when a life is valuable, there is further value when it is responded to\n\nas valuable, but this could occur through evaluative judgement, without his attendant emotion.\n\nThe product is in one case consistent manners, in the other, beautiful manners."

O Tam! had'st thou but been sae wise As taen thy ain wife Kate's advice! She tauld thee weel thou was a skellum, A bletherin, blusterin, drunken blellum; That frae November till October, Ae market-day thou was na sober; That ilka melder wi' the miller, Thou sat as lang as thou had siller; That ev'ry naig was ca'd a shoe on, The smith and thee gat roarin fou on; That at the Lord's house, ev'n on Sunday, Thou drank wi' Kirkton Jean till Monday. She prophesied, that, late or soon, Thou would be found deep drown'd in Doon; Ot catch'd wi' warlocks in the mirk, By Alloway's auld haunted kirk. Ah, gentle dames! it gars me greet, To think how mony counsels sweet, How mony lengthen'd sage advices, The husband frae the wife despises! But to our tale:—Ae market night, Tam had got planted unco right, Fast by an ingle, bleezing finely, Wi' reaming swats that drank divinely; And at his elbow, Souter Johnie, His ancient, trusty, drouthy crony: Tam lo'ed him like a vera brither; They had been fou for weeks thegither. The night drave on wi' sangs and clatter; And ay the ale was growing better: The landlady and Tam grew gracious Wi' secret favours, sweet, and precious: The souter tauld his queerest stories; The landlord's laugh was ready chorus: The storm without might rair and rustle, Tam did na mind the storm a whistle. Care, mad to see a man sae happy, E'en drown'd himsel amang the nappy: As bees flee hame wi' lades o' treasure, The minutes wing'd their way wi' pleasure; Kings may be blest, but Tam was glorious, O'er a' the ills o' life victorious! But pleasures are like poppies spread, You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed; Or like the snow falls in the river, A moment white—then melts forever; Or like the borealis race, That flit ere you can point their place; Or like the rainbow's lovely form Evanishing amid the storm. Nae man can tether time or tide: The hour approaches Tam maun ride,— That hour, o' night's black arch the key-stane That dreary hour he mounts his beast in; And sic a night he taks the road in, As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in. The wind blew as 'twad blawn its last; The rattling show'rs rose on the blast; The speedy gleams the darkness swallow'd; Loud, deep, and lang the thunder bellow'd: That night, a child might understand, The Deil had business on his hand. Weel mounted on his grey mare, Meg,— A better never lifted leg,— Tam skelpit on thro' dub and mire, Despising wind and rain and fire; Whiles holding fast his guid blue bonnet, Whiles crooning o'er some auld Scots sonnet, Whiles glowrin round wi' prudent cares, Lest bogles catch him unawares. Kirk-Alloway was drawing nigh, Whare ghaists and houlets nightly cry. By this time he was cross the ford, Whare in the snaw the chapman smoor'd; And past the birks and meikle stane, Whare drucken Charlie brak's neckbane: And thro' the whins, and by the cairn, Whare hunters fand the murder'd bairn; And near the thorn, aboon the well, Whare Mungo's mither hang'd hersel. Before him Doon pours all his floods; The doubling storm roars thro' the woods; The lightnings flash from pole to pole, Near and more near the thunders roll; When, glimmering thro' the groaning trees, Kirk-Alloway seem'd in a bleeze: Thro' ilka bore the beams were glancing, And loud resounded mirth and dancing. Inspiring bold John Barleycorn! What dangers thou can'st make us scorn! Wi' tippenny we fear nae evil; Wi' usquebae we'll face the devil! The swats sae ream'd in Tammie's noddle, Fair play, he car'd na deils a boddle. But Maggie stood right sair astonish'd, Till, by the heel and hand admonish'd, She ventur'd forward on the light; And, wow! Tam saw an unco sight! Warlocks and witches in a dance; Nae cotillion brent-new frae France, But hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels Put life and mettle in their heels. A winnock bunker in the east, There sat Auld Nick in shape o' beast: A towzie tyke, black, grim, and large, To gie them music was his charge; He screw'd the pipes and gart them skirl, Till roof and rafters a' did dirl.— Coffins stood round like open presses, That shaw'd the dead in their last dresses; And by some devilish cantraip sleight Each in its cauld hand held a light, By which heroic Tam was able To note upon the haly table A murderer's banes in gibbet airns; Twa span-lang, wee, unchristen'd bairns; A thief, new-cutted frae the rape— Wi' his last gasp his gab did gape; Five tomahawks, wi' blude red-rusted; Five scimitars, wi' murder crusted; A garter, which a babe had strangled; A knife, a father's throat had mangled, Whom his ain son o' life bereft— The grey hairs yet stack to the heft; Wi' mair o' horrible and awfu', Which ev'n to name wad be unlawfu'. As Tammie glowr'd, amaz'd and curious, The mirth and fun grew fast and furious: The piper loud and louder blew, The dancers quick and quicker flew; They reel'd, they set, they cross'd, they cleekit Till ilka carlin swat and reekit And coost her duddies to the wark And linket at it in her sark! Now Tam, O Tam! had thae been queans, A' plump and strapping in their teens! Their sarks, instead o' creeshie flannen, Been snaw-white seventeen hunder linen!— Thir breeks o' mine, my only pair, That ance were plush, o' gude blue hair, I wad hae gien them aff y hurdies, For ae blink o' the bonie burdies! But wither'd beldams, auld and droll, Rigwoodie hags wad spean a foal, Lowping and flinging on a crummock. I wonder didna turn thy stomach. But Tam ken'd what was what fu' brawlie; There was ae winsom wench and walie, That night enlisted in the core (Lang after ken'd on Carrick shore. For mony a beast to dead she shot, And perish'd mony a bonie boat, And shook baith meikle corn and bear, And kept the country-side in fear); Her cutty sark o' Paisley harn, That while a lassie she had worn, In longitude tho' sorely scanty, It was her best, and she was vauntie. Ah! little ken'd thy reverend grannie, That sark she coft for her wee Nannie, Wi' twa pund Scots ('twas a' her riches), Wad ever grac'd a dance of witches! But here my Muse her wing maun cow'r, Sic flights are far beyond her pow'r; To sing how Nannie lap and flang, (A souple jad she was and strang), And how Tam stood like ane bewitch'd, And thought his very een enrich'd; Even Satan glowr'd and fidg'd fu' fain, And hotch'd and blew wi' might and main: Till first ae caper, syne anither, Tam tint his reason a' thegither, And roars out, \"Weel done, Cutty-sark!\" And in an instant all was dark: And scarcely had he Maggie rallied, When out the hellish legion sallied. As bees bizz out wi' angry fyke, When plundering herds assail their byke; As open pussie's mortal foes, When, pop! she starts before their nose; As eager runs the market-crowd, When \"Catch the thief!\" resounds aloud; So Maggie runs, the witches follow, Wi' mony an eldritch skriech and hollo. Ah, Tam! ah, Tam! thou'll get thy fairin! In hell they'll roast thee like a herrin! In vain thy Kate awaits thy comin! Kate soon will be a woefu' woman! Now, do thy speedy utmost, Meg, And win the key-stane of the brig: There at them thou thy tail may toss, A running stream they dare na cross. But ere the key-stane she could make, The fient a tail she had to shake! For Nannie far before the rest, Hard upon noble Maggie prest, And flew at Tam wi' furious ettle; But little wist she Maggie's mettle— Ae spring brought aff her master hale But left behind her ain grey tail: The carlin claught her by the rump, And left poor Maggie scarce a stump. Now, wha this tale o' truth shall read, Ilk man and mother's son, take heed, Whene'er to drink you are inclin'd, Or cutty-sarks run in your mind, Think, ye may buy the joys o'er dear, Remember Tam o' Shanter's mear."

        "title": "Love's Nocturn",
        "author": "Dante Gabriel Rossetti",
        "poem": "Master of the murmuring courts Where the shapes of sleep convene!— Lo! my spirit here exhorts All the powers of thy demesne For their aid to woo my queen. What reports Yield thy jealous courts unseen? Vaporous, unaccountable, Dreamland lies forlorn of light, Hollow like a breathing shell. Ah! that from all dreams I might Choose one dream and guide its flight! I know well What her sleep should tell to-night. There the dreams are multitudes: Some that will not wait for sleep, Deep within the August woods; Some that hum while rest may steep Weary labour laid a-heap; Interludes, Some, of grievous moods that weep. Poets' fancies all are there: There the elf-girls flood with wings Valleys full of plaintive air; There breathe perfumes; there in rings Whirl the foam-bewildered springs; Siren there Winds her dizzy hair and sings. Thence the one dream mutually Dreamed in bridal unison, Less than waking ecstasy; Half-formed visions that make moan In the house of birth alone; And what we At death's wicket see, unknown. But for mine own sleep, it lies In one gracious form's control, Fair with honourable eyes, Lamps of a translucent soul: O their glance is loftiest dole, Sweet and wise, Wherein Love descries his goal. Reft of her, my dreams are all Clammy trance that fears the sky: Changing footpaths shift and fall; From polluted coverts nigh, Miserable phantoms sigh; Quakes the pall, And the funeral goes by. Master, is it soothly said That, as echoes of man's speech Far in secret clefts are made, So do all men's bodies reach Shadows o'er thy sunken beach,— Shape or shade In those halls pourtrayed of each? Ah! might I, by thy good grace Groping in the windy stair, (Darkness and the breath of space Like loud waters everywhere,) Meeting mine own image there Face to face, Send it from that place to her! Nay, not I; but oh! do thou, Master, from thy shadowkind Call my body's phantom now: Bid it bear its face declin'd Till its flight her slumbers find, And her brow Feel its presence bow like wind. Where in groves the gracile Spring Trembles, with mute orison Confidently strengthening, Water's voice and wind's as one Shed an echo in the sun. Soft as Spring, Master, bid it sing and moan. Song shall tell how glad and strong Is the night she soothes alway; Moan shall grieve with that parched tongue Of the brazen hours of day: Sounds as of the springtide they, Moan and song, While the chill months long for May. Not the prayers which with all leave The world's fluent woes prefer,— Not the praise the world doth give, Dulcet fulsome whisperer;— Let it yield my love to her, And achieve Strength that shall not grieve or err. Wheresoe'er my dreams befall, Both at night-watch, (let it say,) And where round the sundial The reluctant hours of day, Heartless, hopeless of their way, Rest and call;— There her glance doth fall and stay. Suddenly her face is there: So do mounting vapours wreathe Subtle-scented transports where The black firwood sets its teeth. Part the boughs and look beneath,— Lilies share Secret waters there, and breathe. Master, bid my shadow bend Whispering thus till birth of light, Lest new shapes that sleep may send Scatter all its work to flight;— Master, master of the night, Bid it spend Speech, song, prayer, and end aright. Yet, ah me! if at her head There another phantom lean Murmuring o'er the fragrant bed,— Ah! and if my spirit's queen Smile those alien prayers between,— Ah! poor shade! Shall it strive, or fade unseen? How should love's own messenger Strive with love and be love's foe? Master, nay! If thus, in her, Sleep a wedded heart should show,— Silent let mine image go, Its old share Of thy spell-bound air to know. Like a vapour wan and mute, Like a flame, so let it pass; One low sigh across her lute, One dull breath against her glass; And to my sad soul, alas! One salute Cold as when Death's foot shall pass. Then, too, let all hopes of mine, All vain hopes by night and day, Slowly at thy summoning sign Rise up pallid and obey. Dreams, if this is thus, were they:— Be they thine, And to dreamworld pine away. Yet from old time, life, not death, Master, in thy rule is rife: Lo! through thee, with mingling breath, Adam woke beside his wife. O Love bring me so, for strife, Force and faith, Bring me so not death but life! Yea, to Love himself is pour'd This frail song of hope and fear. Thou art Love, of one accord With kind Sleep to bring her near, Still-eyed, deep-eyed, ah how dear. Master, Lord, In her name implor'd, O hear!"

        "poem": "Written in A Moment of Exasperation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can you lie so still? All day I watch And never a blade of all the green sod moves To show where restlessly you toss and turn, And fling a desperate arm or draw up knees Stiffened and aching from their long disuse; I watch all night and not one ghost comes forth To take its freedom of the midnight hour. Oh, have you no rebellion in your bones? The very worms must scorn you where you lie, A pallid mouldering acquiescent folk, Meek habitants of unresented graves. Why are you there in your straight row on row Where I must ever see you from my bed That in your mere dumb presence iterate The text so weary in my ears: \"Lie still And rest; be patient and lie still and rest.\" I'll not be patient! I will not lie still! There is a brown road runs between the pines, And further on the purple woodlands lie, And still beyond blue mountains lift and loom; And I would walk the road and I would be Deep in the wooded shade and I would reach The windy mountain tops that touch the clouds. My eyes may follow but my feet are held. Recumbent as you others must I too Submit? Be mimic of your movelessness With pillow and counterpane for stone and sod? And if the many sayings of the wise Teach of submission I will not submit But with a spirit all unreconciled Flash an unquenched defiance to the stars. Better it is to walk, to run, to dance, Better it is to laugh and leap and sing, To know the open skies of dawn and night, To move untrammeled down the flaming noon, And I will clamour it through weary days Keeping the edge of deprivation sharp, Nor with the pliant speaking on my lips Of resignation, sister to defeat. I'll not be patient. I will not lie still. And in ironic quietude who is The despot of our days and lord of dust Needs but, scarce heeding, wait to drop Grim casual comment on rebellion's end; \"Yes, yes . . Wilful and petulant but now As dead and quiet as the others are.\" And this each body and ghost of you hath heard That in your graves do therefore lie so still."

Is there a wall\n\nthese tall presences can look over and see hell?\n\nIf an angel fell off a cloud, would he leave a hole\n\nin a river and would the hole float along endlessly\n\nfilled with the silent letters of every angelic word?\n\nIf an angel delivered the mail, would he arrive\n\nin a blinding rush of wings or would he just assume\n\nthe appearance of the regular mailman and\n\nwhistle up the driveway reading the postcards?\n\nNo, the medieval theologians control the court.\n\nThe only question you ever hear is about\n\nthe little dance floor on the head of a pin\n\nwhere halos are meant to converge and drift invisibly.\n\nIt is designed to make us think in millions,\n\nbillions, to make us run out of numbers and collapse\n\ninto infinity, but perhaps the answer is simply one:\n\none female angel dancing alone in her stocking feet,\n\na small jazz combo working in the background.\n\nShe sways like a branch in the wind, her beautiful\n\neyes closed, and the tall thin bassist leans over\n\nto glance at his watch because she has been dancing\n\nforever, and now it is very late, even for musicians."

But there's a misconception I was laboring under, and you are too, viz. that the imagination in your vicinity is free and powerful. After all, you say, you've been creating yourself all along imaginatively. You imagine yourself playing golf or hiking in the Olympics or writing a poem and then it becomes true. But you still have to do it, you have to exert yourself, will, courage, whatever you've got, you're mired in the unimaginative. Here I imagine a letter and it's written. Takes about two-fifths of a second, your time. Hell, this is heaven, man. I can deluge Congress with letters telling every one of those mendacious sons of bitches exactly what he or she is, in maybe about half an hour. In spite of your Buddhist proclivities, when you imagine bliss you still must struggle to get there. By the way the Buddha has his place across town on Elysian Drive. We call him Bud. He's lost weight and got new dentures, and he looks a hell of a lot better than he used to. He always carries a jumping jack with him everywhere just for contemplation, but he doesn't make it jump. He only looks at it. Meanwhile Sidney and Dizzy, Uncle Ben and Papa Yancey, are over by Sylvester's Grot making the sweetest, cheerfulest blues you ever heard. The air, so called, is full of it. Poems are fluttering everywhere like seed from a cottonwood tree. Sam, the remarkable truth is I can do any fucking thing I want. Speaking of which there's this dazzling young Naomi who wiped out on I-80 just west of Truckee last winter, and I think this is the moment for me to go and pay her my respects. Don't go way. I'll be right back."
